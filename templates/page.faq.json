Animal exosomes, for example, can be sensitive to temperature changes and mechanical stress, which can lead to their damage or loss of activity. Plant exosomes, on the other hand, can lose stability due to oxidation or decomposition when exposed to light or high humidity. <br\/>Stimulating the production of your own exosomes is currently an advantage, as it helps to optimize natural processes in the body and supports more harmonious interaction between cells. In addition, stimulating the production of its own exosomes contributes to the natural renewal of the skin and the reduction of signs of aging without the need for external sources, without the risk of causing allergic reactions or other undesirable effects.<br\/><\/p>"
